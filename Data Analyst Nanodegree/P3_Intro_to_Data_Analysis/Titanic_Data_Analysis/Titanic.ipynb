    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Examining the Data Dictionary Table, the following questions can be considered as sanity checks for the survival chance:\n",
    "1. SES: How did socio-economic status affect the survival?\n",
    "2. Sex: Did female have a priority to lifeboats?\n",
    "3. Age: Did children have better chances to survive than adults?\n",
    "4. Family: Comparison of passengers travelling alone with those travelling with their family?\n",
    "5. Fare: How fare relates with SES?\n",
    "6. Crew: What happened to the crew?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a hypothesis testing will be used to make more valid judgements for one of the above factors.\n",

    "From the previous analysis it was deduced that:\n",
    "* Passengers with a higher ticket class had at least a double chance to survive.\n",
    "* Females had 4 times more chances to survive than the males.\n",
    "* Children had 1.4 times greater survival rate than adults.\n",
    "* Family passengers survival rate was 1.7 better than solitary ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a statistically significant conclusion can be made only for the age factor, since the t-test indicated that children had obviously more posibilities to survive (with less than one in a thousand chance of being wrong).\n",
